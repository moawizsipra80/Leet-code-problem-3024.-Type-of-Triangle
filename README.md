# Leet-code-problem-3024.-Type-of-Triangle
Given an array `nums` of 3 integers representing triangle sides, return its type: **"equilateral"**, **"isosceles"**, **"scalene"**, or **"none"** if the triangle inequality is not satisfied. A triangle is valid only if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third.
